# Tech-Blog
## Just a little project in webdev

Hi there,

This little Tech blog was designed to just be a simple little CMS. 
It allows users to create accounts, write articles (and update them or delete them asteh needs may be) and also comment on other articles.

It uses Handlebars.js as the templating engine, express as it's server and bulma as it's css framework.

It's nothing much, but it'll do the trick.
